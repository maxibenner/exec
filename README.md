# Exec

A minimal, native macOS coding agent. Starts up lightning fast and offers hotkeys for quick navigation and config changes.

Currently supports two providers: OpenAI via subscription and DeepSeek via API key.

## Get started

Needs to be built from source. Requires macOS 14+, Xcode 26 or later (including the Swift toolchain and Icon Composer asset compiler).

```sh
./scripts/build-app.sh
```

## Keyboard controls

| Action                          | Shortcut            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| New conversation                | ⌘T                  |
| Switch conversations            | ⌘1 - ⌘9             |
| Detach conversation             | ⌘D                  |
| Move detached conversation back | ⌘W                  |
| Delete conversation             | ⌘⇧Delete            |
| Interrupt turn                  | Escape              |

Slash commands: `/model`, `/reasoning`, `/auto-approve`, `/compact`, `/workspace`, `/finder`, `/terminal`.

## Development

No third-party dependencies. Open `Package.swift` in Xcode, or run:

```sh
./scripts/test.sh
./scripts/build-app.sh
```

Tests use isolated stores and fake transports, not your Keychain or live model calls. 

For consistent Keychain access across rebuilds, configure a stable signing certificate:

```sh
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
git config --local exec.signingIdentity "<certificate SHA-1>"
REQUIRE_STABLE_SIGNING=1 ./scripts/build-app.sh
```
